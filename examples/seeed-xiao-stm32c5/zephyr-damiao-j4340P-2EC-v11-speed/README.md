# XIAO STM32C5 Damiao DM-J4340P-2EC V1.1 24V Speed Sample

This sample controls a Damiao DM-J4340P-2EC V1.1 24V integrated motor/driver
through Classic CAN at 1 Mbps. It uses Damiao speed mode and automatically
cycles through speed gears for CAN waveform observation.

## Wiring

```text
XIAO CAN_H  -> motor CAN_H
XIAO CAN_L  -> motor CAN_L
XIAO GND    -> motor GND / 24V-
24V+        -> motor VCC
24V-        -> motor GND
```

Use the XIAO board CANH/CANL pins behind the CAN transceiver. Do not connect
MCU CAN_TX/CAN_RX logic pins directly to the motor CANH/CANL differential bus.

## Speed Gears

The DM-J4340P-2EC V1.1 24V manual lists rated speed as 120 rpm and no-load
maximum speed as 200 rpm. This sample uses conservative test speeds below the
rated speed:

| Gear | Speed | Approx rpm |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| 0 | 0.0 rad/s | 0 rpm |
| 1 | 3.0 rad/s | 28.6 rpm |
| 2 | 6.0 rad/s | 57.3 rpm |

The firmware advances one gear every 5 seconds:

```text
0 -> 3 -> 6 -> 3 -> 0 rad/s
```

## CAN Protocol

The sample assumes the motor is already configured to speed mode by the Damiao
PC tool. In speed mode the command frame is:

```text
CAN ID: 0x200 + motor_id
D[0..3]: v_des float, little-endian, rad/s
DLC: 4
```

The default `DAMIAO_MOTOR_ID` is `1`.

At startup the firmware writes only the runtime control mode over CAN:

```text
CTRL_MODE = 3       speed mode
```

The sample reads `ACC`, `DEC`, `MAX_SPD`, `VMAX`, `KP_ASR`, `KI_ASR`, `Deta`,
and `VBus` for diagnostics, but does not write speed-loop or speed-limit
parameters and does not send Damiao's "store parameters" command.

## Build

```powershell
cd D:\workspace\platform-seeedboards\examples\seeed-xiao-stm32c5\zephyr-damiao-j4340P-2EC-v11-speed
pio run
```

The build output includes:

```text
.pio\build\seeed-xiao-stm32c5\firmware.uf2
```

## Notes

The MCU sends target speed commands only. Damiao's internal driver handles the
motor commutation, current loop, velocity loop, encoder feedback, and protection.
